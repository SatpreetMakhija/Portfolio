I'm a software engineer at Google working on Google Distributed Cloud - [Hosted](https://cloud.google.com/distributed-cloud-hosted?hl=en). I am passionate about software and distributed systems. Currently, I am honing my skills in Go and [K8s](https://kubernetes.io/). 

During my bachelors at [Ashoka University](https://ashoka.edu.in/), I majored in Computer Science. Beyond work, I spend time playing tennis and reading books. You can find my reading list [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/116660458-sama?ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=to-read).

Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically. -->
