Hey there! Welcome to my website. My name is Satpreet Makhija. I'm a software engineer at Google in the Google Distributed Cloud team. Currently, I'm
working on a [device](https://cloud.google.com/distributed-cloud/hosted/docs/latest/appliance/overview) that brings cloud capabilities to the edge.

I care deeply about software systems and how they can be used to solve problems. When I'm not building software, I can be found playing tennis, reading books or meditating. You can find my reading list [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/116660458-satpreet?ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=read).

I enjoy making friends online who share similar interests. Don't hesitate to reach out at `work.<MY_FIRST_NAME>@gmail.com`.
