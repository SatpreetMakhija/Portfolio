I work at [Google](https://cloud.google.com) as a Strategic Cloud Engineer in the cloud division. I help my clients make the most out of Google Cloud products. I specialise in data.

During my Bachelors degree at [Ashoka University](https://ashoka.edu.in/), I majored in Computer Science with a minor in Economics.

Beyond work, I spend time playing tennis and reading books. You can find my reading list [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/116660458-sama?ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=to-read).
