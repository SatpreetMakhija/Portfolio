A list of people who've left a considerable mark on who I am.


- [Naval Ravikant](https://nav.al/) sparked the intellectual curiosity in me. My walk down computer science alley has his footprints all the way through.
- [David Deutsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Deutsch) opened my mind to what knowledge is and what makes us, humans, different. His book <i>
The Beginning of Infinity </i> is like a software upgrade for the mind. Chapters titled <i> The Reach of Explanations </i> and <i> Why are flowers beautiful?  </i> have changed my thinking in profound ways.
- [Jordan Peterson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Peterson) made realise why it is important to learn how to read and write.
- [Eckhart Tolle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eckhart_Tolle) helped me learn how to deal with the mind. There are passages in his book _The Power of Now_ that put me in meditative state just by reading them.
- [Rafael Nadal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal) helped me develop a never give up attitude.
